/**
 * This class is used to test XML and annotation merging. This class is mapped
 * in: eclipselink-xml-merge-model/orm-annotation-merge-advanced-entity-mappings.xml
 *
 * This class is currently marked as metadata-complete=true meaning all the
 * annotations defined here should be ignored (somewhat defeating the purpose
 * of XML and Annotation merging testing)
 *
 * Also there are no automated tests that go along with these models, see the
 * test suite: EntityMappingsMergeAdvancedJUnitTestCase. It tests through
 * inspecting descriptor settings only and by no means does extensive
 * validation of all the metadata and defaults.
